				<td>French Bulldog</td>
				<td>Bred primarily as companion dogs, Frenchies crave all the love and affection we humans have to offer. They’re just as satisfied playing with kids and other dogs as they are being a couch potato. Goofy, yet intelligent, French bulldogs make an easygoing best friend for any dog lover.</td>

			<td>Dachshunds</td>
			<td>Easily recognized by its long body and stubby legs, the small and spunky dachshund (pronounced dahks-hund) has long been a family favorite. Though they may not look it, dachshunds were bred as ferocious hunters, employed on the trail to crawl into badger and rabbit holes to flush out their prey. Still sometimes used as hunting dogs, most modern dachshunds are just as happy with plenty of daily play followed by lazing around the home with their humans.</td>
